# HN_Replicate

This code repository is for replication/verification of the analysis in the manuscript **Multicenter assessment of artificial intelligence system to reduce pediatric antenatal hydronephrosis follow-up using renal ultrasound**. Code for the power analysis portion of this manuscript can be found at https://github.com/ErikinBC/power_roc. 

This codebase replicates the generation of those results and an example training and test run of the model with a small subset of anonymized samples. 

These scripts use R v4.0.2 and python v3.8 have been tested on windows, unix, and mac systems with >8GB of RAM.
