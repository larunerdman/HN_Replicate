# HN_Replicate

This code repository is for replication/verification of the analysis in the manuscript **Effective assessment of pediatric antenatal hydronephrosis patients using a clinical deep learning algorithm**. The original code used to generate each result in the paper can be found here: https://github.com/larunerdman/HN_obstruction

This codebase replicates the generation of those results and an example training and test run of the model with a small subset of anonymized samples. 

These scripts use R v4.0.2 and python v3.8 have been tested on windows, unix, and mac systems with >8GB of RAM.
